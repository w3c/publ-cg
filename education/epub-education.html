            <h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
            <p>Digital content in education has the potential to significantly improve learning outcomes, as it can better support accessibility, adapt to individual learning modes, increase engagement and experiential learning through interactivity, provide immediate assessments and analytics, and increase social connectivity.</p>
            <p>To this end, the EPUB for Education profile defined in this specification represents the effort to adapt the functionality of the EPUB&reg; 3 format to the unique structural, semantic and behavioral requirements of educational publishing.</p>
            <p>The profile builds on the EPUB 3 specification in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>It adds semantics for common educational publishing components and structures.</li>
            <li>It defines how to include content that may be created external to the narrative text workflow, such as interactives and assessment (e.g., QTI).</li>
            
            <li>It includes accessibility features to enable compliance with educational standards.</li>
            
            <li>It enables the identification of discrete content entities.</li>
            <li>It allows the embedding of shared educational scriptable components.</li>
            <li>It adds support for annotations.</li>
            <li>It defines guidelines for the production and inclusion of images.</li>

            <h2>Relationship to Other Specifications</h2>

      
               <p>As a profile of EPUB 3, these guidelines build on the functionality defined in the following core specifications:</p>
               
               
               <ul>
               <li>EPUB Publications 3.0.1 [[!Publications301]]</li>

               <li>EPUB Media Overlays 3.0.1  [[!MediaOverlays301]]</li>
               </ul>
<p>Unless explicitly overridden, this profile inherits all requirements defined in these specifications.</p>
<p>Education-compliant Publications are always valid EPUB 3 Publications, but, due to the additional production requirements detailed in this document, the reverse is not necessarily true.</p>

<h1>Education Document Models</h1>

<section id="reflowable-publications">

<h2>Reflowable Publications</h2>
<p>The primary focus of this version of the EPUB for Education profile is on the creation of reflowable XHTML-based EPUB Publications.</p>
<p>Reflowable Renditions of the content are typically more accessible than pre-paginated (fixed layout) Renditions, making the content more widely accessible to a broader range of students.</p>
<p>The semantics defined in this profile are also better suited to annotating markup structures that have not been artificially broken by page boundaries, and the requisite chunking of content into separate files that practice causes. Navigation is similarly simplified for users of assistive technologies when content structures are not broken apart by pagination.</p>
<p>The use of reflowable Renditions is therefore strongly RECOMMENDED.</p>

</section>

<section id="fixed-layout-publications">

<h2>Fixed-Layout Publications</h2>
<p>Although the creation of <a href="#reflowable-publications">reflowable EPUB Publications</a> is the preferred content model for the EPUB for Education profile, Authors MAY create Fixed-Layout Publications provided they are produced to be accessible to a wide audience.</p>
<p>This specification does not attempt to define accessibility for all users, but conformant Fixed-Layout Publications MUST meet all of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>

<li>be constructed from text-based XHTML or SVG Content Documents (i.e., text content is not represented as images);</li>

<li>use appropriate [[HTML5]] markup for the structures being represented (i.e., avoid the generic <code>span</code> and <code>div</code> elements unless no more appropriate markup is available).</li>
<li>retain the logical reading order of the text content (i.e., text appears in the markup in the order in which it is expected to be read);</li>
<li>not position text over background images in such a way that it will present difficulty reading (e.g., poor contrast).</li>
</ul>
<p>These requirements represent the minimum threshold to be conformant with this profile. They do not replace any local or national accessibility requirements an Author has to meet in order to sell and distribute their content for educational use.</p>
<p>Note that due to the paginated nature of fixed layouts, Fixed-Layout Publications are exempt from the requirements in <a href="#content-structure">Content Structure</a>.</p>

</section>
<section id="multiple-rendition-publications">

<h2>Multiple-Rendition Publications</h2>
<p>EPUB Publications that conform to this profile MAY contain more than one Rendition of the content, but each Rendition MUST conform to the requirements for reflowable or fixed-layout content defined in this specification.</p>
<p>When an EPUB Container includes more than one Rendition, it MUST conform to the requirements for multiple-Rendition EPUB Publications defined in [[MultipleRenditions]]. In addition to the Release Identifier, the <code>metadata.xml</code> file MUST include the <code>dc:type</code> identifier &quot;<code>education</code>&quot;.</p>

<p class="note">Authors are encouraged to include a Rendition Mapping Document to allow Users to switch from one Rendition to another without losing their place (e.g., to simplify moving between fixed-layout and reflowable Renditions, or from a structured audio to text Rendition).</p>

<section>

<h2>Teacher&#39;s Editions and Guides</h2>

<section>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Teacher&#39;s editions and guides are important tools in educational instruction. Both provide guidance to the teacher, but a teacher&#39;s edition represents a superset of the work the students are using, while a teacher&#39;s guide typically provides general instruction and guidance on the curriculum (i.e., there is no student edition).</p>
<p>This section does not introduce special processing requirements for either. In particular, it is assumed that teacher and student editions are packaged separately, as EPUB &#8210; and the Open Web Platform generally &#8210; does not provide a means of reliably hiding content from different classes of Users.</p>

</section>
<section>
<h3>Identification</h3>


<section>

<h4>Publication</h4>
<p>A teacher&#39;s edition MUST be identified as such in the package metadata by including a <code>dc:type</code> element [[!Publications301]] with the value &quot;<code>teacher-edition</code>&quot;.</p>

<p>The following example shows an EPUB Publication identified as a teacher&#39;s edition.</p>


<pre class="example">
&lt;metadata xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot;&gt;
&lt;dc:type&gt;teacher-edition&lt;/dc:type&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&hellip;
&lt;/metadata&gt;
</pre>


<p>A teacher&#39;s guide MUST be identified with the value &quot;<code>teacher-guide</code>&quot;.</p>

<p>The following example shows an EPUB Publication identified as a teacher&#39;s guide.</p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;metadata xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot;&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;dc:type&gt;teacher-guide&lt;/dc:type&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&hellip;
&lt;/metadata&gt;
</pre>

<p>Teacher&#39;s guides and editions are also identified as compliant with the EPUB for Education profile as defined in <a href="#profile-identification">Profile Identification</a>, so MUST conform to all requirements in this specification.</p>

<p>The following example shows both the edpub and a teacher&#39;s guide identifiers.</p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;metadata xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot;&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;dc:type&gt;teacher-guide&lt;/dc:type&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;dc:type&gt;education&lt;/dc:type&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&hellip;
&lt;/metadata&gt;
</pre>

</section>

<section>
<h4>Student Edition</h4>
<p>As a teacher&#39;s edition represents an annotated version of a student edition, it SHOULD identify the corresponding student edition in a <code>dc:source</code> element:</p>

<p>The following example shows a teacher edition that includes the source student edition identifier.</p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;metadata xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot;&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;dc:type&gt;teacher-edition&lt;/dc:type&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;dc:source&gt;urn:isbn:9780000000001&lt;/dc:source&gt;
&nbsp; &hellip;
&lt;/metadata&gt;
</pre>

<p class="note">As teacher&#39;s guides do not have student editions, this guideline does not apply to their production.</p>

</section>
</section>

<section>

<h3>Content</h3>


<section>

<h4>Structural Semantics</h4>
<p>The EPUB for Education content model does not include structural semantics specifically for the construction of teacher editions and guides, but the inclusion of such semantics is under consideration for a future version of the profile.</p>
<p>At this time, the use of semantics defined in <a href="#structural-semantics">Structural Semantics</a> is RECOMMENDED, where applicable.</p>
</section>

<section>

<h4>Styling</h4>
<p>The standardization of CSS class names for controlling the appearance of teacher-specific content is under consideration for a future version of this profile.</p>
</section>

<section>

<h4>Audience</h4>
<p>As a teacher&#39;s edition contains both the text of the student edition together with annotations, answers and other instructional aids for the teacher, there is a need to accessibly differentiate the teacher content from the content that all students have access to. Reliance on visual CSS styling alone, for example, impacts on the overall usability by instructors.</p>
<p>While the use of structural semantics enhances the meaning of the content, it does not, in itself, indicate who the content was intended for. Instead, to address discoverability for users of assistive technologies, all teacher content MUST be labeled using the [[!ARIA]] <code>aria-label</code> attribute.</p>

<p>The following example shows an answer section labeled as belonging to the teacher edition</p>
<pre class="example">
&lt;section epub:type=&quot;answers&quot; aria-label=&quot;teacher edition content&quot;&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&hellip;
&lt;/section&gt;
</pre>

<p>This specification does not require specific language for this attribute to allow for localization, but the text used should clearly identify the audience is teachers.</p>



<p class="note">As teacher&#39;s guides are exclusively for teachers, content does not have to labelled.</p>


<p>The audience MAY also be specified using the [[schema.org]] <code>audience</code> property for reliable machine processing (e.g., to selectively hide teacher-only content in a Reading System, or to enable filtering of content prior to distribution). Processing of this metadata is OPTIONAL.</p>

<p>The following example shows the inclusion of the schema.org <code>audience</code> property to identify that an answers section is intended only for teachers.</p>


<pre class="example">
&lt;section id=&quot;answers01&quot;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;aria-label=&quot;teacher edition content&quot;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;epub:type=&quot;answers&quot;&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;meta resource=&quot;#answers01&quot;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; typeof=&quot;schema:WebPageElement&quot;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; property=&quot;schema:audience&quot;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; content=&quot;teacher&quot;/&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &hellip;
&lt;/section&gt;
</pre>

</section>

<section>

<h4>Student Content</h4>
<p>For accessibility purposes, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that student content not be represented as annotated images in teacher&#39;s editions.</p>

<h1>Content Structure</h1>


<section>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This section is informative</p>
<p>This section outlines key content structuring guidelines for the production of EPUB Publications that conform to this profile. Only differences from the core suite of EPUB specifications are noted.</p>

</section>
<section>

<h2>Sectioning</h2>
<p>The <code>section</code> element MUST be used only to group sections of content that contribute to the structural hierarchy (e.g., that could appear in the table of contents). Such content is contained in <code>linear spine items</code> [[Publications301]]; secondary non-linear content is not subject to the requirements in this section.</p>
<p>If the root of an XHTML Content Document consists of a single section of content, a <code>section</code> wrapper MAY be omitted (i.e., the <code>body</code> represents the implied section). Any subsections of the root section MUST be wrapped in <code>section</code> tags.</p>
<p>Each section MUST have a heading expressed either in an [[HTML5]] <code>ranked heading element</code> or an [[ARIA]] <code>aria-label</code> attribute. Sections MUST NOT have more than one heading element, but MAY include both a heading element and an <code>aria-label</code>. If a section includes both a label and a heading, the value of the <code>aria-label</code> attribute MUST NOT be the same as the heading (use the [[ARIA]] <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute to explicitly link a heading to its section).</p>

<p>A <code>section</code> can be divided into subsections by nesting the <code>section</code> element, but once the first subsection is introduced only additional subsections are allowed to follow it (i.e., only another <code>section</code> element can follow the end of a subsection). This requirement also applies to the use of the <code>section</code> elements for subsectioning in any other [[HTML5]] <code>sectioning content</code>.</p>

<p>The following example shows how subsections must be contiguous.</p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;section&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;h1&gt;Section 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;p&gt;&hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;section&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;h2&gt;Subsection 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&hellip;
&nbsp; &lt;/section&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;section&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;h2&gt;Subsection 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&hellip;
&nbsp; &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</pre>

<p class="note">The restriction against content between section elements exists to reduce the confusion that can arise when content is read by assistive technologies, as it is not always clear what section the continuation of content belongs to.</p>



<p>For article-based EPUB Publications, the [[HTML5]] <code>article</code> element MAY be used in place of the <code>section</code> element to group each article. The use of the element MUST follow the requirements defined in this section, including the use of <code>section</code> elements to represent the internal hierarchy.</p>
</section>

<section>

<h2 class="c14">Titles and Headings</h2>


<section>

<h3>Titled Sections</h3>
<p>[[HTML5]] <code>heading elements</code> MUST be used to provide headings only for [[HTML5]] <code>sectioning content</code> (including the <code>body</code> element).</p>

<p>When using a heading element for a section, the rank MUST reflect the nesting of that section within the document hierarchy (as noted in <a class="c2" href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/sections.html#headings-and-sections">4.3.10 Headings and sections</a> [[HTML5]]). For example, a top-level section will have an <code>h1</code> heading, child sections of it will have <code>h2</code> headings, and so on. Note that untitled sections are included when determining the current heading rank (see <a href="#untitled-sections">Untitled Sections</a> for more information).</p>
<p>The heading does not have to be the first element of the section, and MAY be included inside a [[HTML5]] <code>header</code> element. If the section also includes a subtitle in a separate element, both the heading and subtitle MUST be enclosed in a <code>header</code>.</p>
<pre class="example">
&lt;header&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;h1&gt;Chapter 1. The Battle&lt;/h1&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;p epub:type=&quot;subtitle&quot;&gt;Once More Unto the Breach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
</pre>


<p class="note">See <a class="c2" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/common-idioms.html#sub-head">4.12.1 Subheadings, subtitles, alternative titles and taglines</a> [[HTML5]] for additional markup patterns for subtitles.</p>
<p>The application of headings MUST reflect the hierarchy regardless of how the content has been chunked for distribution (i.e., it is not necessary that the first section in each file begin with an <code>h1</code>).</p>
<p>The [[ARIA]] <code>aria-label</code> attribute MUST NOT be included on a <code>section</code> if it provides the same text already available in a ranked heading, as it can lead to duplicate announcement of the heading to users of assistive technologies.</p>

</section>
<section id="untitled-sections">

<h3>Untitled Sections</h3>
<p>If a section of content in the document hierarchy does not have an explicit heading (e.g., an untitled introduction) &#8210; or sectioning is used to group significant content, such as learning objectives, that a User using an AT would need access to &#8210; the [[ARIA]] <code>aria-label</code> attribute MUST be used to provide an accessible name.</p>
<p>Adding this attribute allows users of assistive technologies to navigate to the section despite the lack of a heading, in addition to giving meaningful context.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of an explicit ranked heading, untitled sections are still part of the document&#39;s structural hierarchy and affect the heading rank of any child sections they contain. For example, the untitled <code>section</code> in the following example counts as the second level in the document outline, so the next ranked heading is an <code>h3</code> even though no <code>h2</code> appears in the markup:</p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;section epub:type=&quot;chapter&quot;&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;h1&gt;Chapter 1: Lists&lt;/h1&gt;
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;section aria-label=&quot;Chapter body&quot;&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;section epub:type=&quot;learning-objectives&quot;&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;h3&gt;1.2 Learning Objectives List&lt;/h3&gt;
</pre>

</section>

<section id="deep-nesting">


<h3>Deep Nesting</h3>
<p>When the document hierarchy exceeds six levels of nesting, re-use the <code>h6</code> element for the seventh nesting level and deeper. Avoid deep nesting of content, if possible, as the flattened structure below the sixth heading level impacts on the ability of users of assistive technologies (AT) to move through the document without repeatedly returning to the table of contents.</p>
<p>Do not use heading elements where the heading does not reflect the document hierarchy, as this use will impact on movement by AT users (e.g., inside figure captions).</p>

</section>
<section id="structured-components">


<h3>Structured Components</h3>
<p>When <code>aside</code>, <code>article</code> and <code>nav</code> elements with headings are included in a section, the heading rank MUST start one level lower than the containing section (e.g., if a <code>section</code> has an <code>h3</code> heading, an <code>aside</code> within it will start with an <code>h4</code> heading).</p>

<p class="note">These terms will remain under active development for the duration of the EPUB for Education initiative. It is anticipated that more terms will be added in subsequent iterations. Similarly, some terms may be deprecated or removed.</p>




<p>The EPUB for Education profile includes a set of structural semantic terms and content production rules designed to standardize the markup of educational materials.</p>

<p>The formal definitions of these terms, and requirements for their use, are defined in the normative EPUB Education Structural Semantics Vocabulary [[EDUStructure]]</a>.</p>



<p>Publishers are strongly RECOMMENDED to represent all publication structures using the markup and terms defined in [[EDUStructure]]. The use of other terms from [[StructureVocab]] is OPTIONAL, as is the use of custom terms.</p>
<p>Following is a categorized list of the terms available, with links to their definitions. Note that categorization does not imply usage restrictions, particularly in the case of sectioning terms.</p>

<h2>Semantic Enrichment</h2>
<p>The use of RDFa Lite <a class="c2" href="#id.qkmm9vck7s3i">[RDFaLite]</a> is RECOMMENDED for enriching content.</p>
<p>Examples of content enrichment in this specification use RDFa Lite syntax.</p>
</section>

<section>

<h2>Pagination</h2>
<p>If a reflowable Rendition has a statically-paginated alternative representation (e.g., print), it is strongly<span class="rfc2119">&nbsp;recommended</span> that <a class="c2" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Tzeq5xwdwLhSdaHStvAthhOFu9UuT8yFmK787yw420/edit#heading=h.8hygsjhkpul0">page break markers</a> be included. Including this information enables students to synchronize their reading with the paginated representation, as many classrooms are mixed print/digital environments.</p>
<p>The pagination source MUST be identified using the <a class="c2" href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html#sec-opf-dcsource">dc:source and source-of properties</a> <a class="c2" href="#kix.gcfl4rhpnwhm">[Publications301]</a> when including markers. The source MAY be a reference to the EPUB Publication if pagination is derived from another Rendition in the Container.</p>
<p>A <code>page-list nav</code> <a class="c2" href="#kix.i7mkocc0itmb">[ContentDocs301]</a> MUST be included in the EPUB Navigation Document when page breaks are included. See <a class="c2" href="#h.3zalt8ku3l0r">7.4 Page List</a> for more information.</p>

</section>

<section>


<h2>Images</h2>
<p>The following guidelines are suggested for the inclusion of image content:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the sRGB [sRGB] color space.</li>
<li>Use [PNG] or [SVG] format for:

<ul><li>line art/vector images;</li>
<li>image fallbacks for math equations and tables;</li>
<li>bitmap images containing text.</li></ul></li>

<li>Use [JPEG] format with 80% quality for photography and all other bitmap images.</li>
<li>Do not exceed 2000 pixels on the longest dimension for block-level art.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">These conformance constraints above boil down to a basic message: A Tool Consumer might have many more demands on it than a Reading System. It needs to host and protect many sensitive credentials. It needs to keep interface contracts on possibly many Tool Provider interface contracts. And it must be available if, for example, an Outcome Result message comes into it in the middle of the night for entry into a gradebook. In general, if an implementer&rsquo;s Reading System is an offline- or remote- device, it is safer and more practical to delegate the embedded launch back to the Tool Provider. If, on the other hand, the reader is a server-based, online reader and is in the same security domain as the Tool Provider, then a Reader-based Tool Consumer is fine.</p>

<h2>Outcomes</h2>

<h3 class="c27 c14"><span class="c20">6.3.1 Introduction</span></h3>
<p class="c35 c14">Following LTI definitions, an Outcome is composed of data that comes from an interactive resource and is used to gather information about the user&rsquo;s response to the resource. Typically this comes from an interactive assessment that the user elects to perform. This data is often routed to gradebooks in learning systems. The Outcome itself encapsulates two distinct objects: </p>
<ol class="c34 lst-kix_bjycmpwvoflm-0 start" start="1"><li>a lineitem identifies the type of the particular activity. For example, there may be exercises at the end of a chapter in an EPUB Publication. A particular lineitem might refer to question 3 of Chapter 17 of the text. The lineitem describes the particular question; e.g., &lsquo;determine the surface area of regular polygons&rsquo;.</li><li>an LISResult identifies a score that a particular student generates for the associated lineitem. Continuing the example above, a result for the lineitem above might identify user &lsquo;jsmith&rsquo; and assign a score of &lsquo;0.76&rsquo;.</li></ol>

<h3 class="c27 c14"><span class="c20">6.3.2 Outcomes Reporting</span></h3>
<p class="c35 c14"><span class="c8">To enable an EPUB Publication to report outcomes via LTI, all learning activities </span><span class="c5 c38 c7">MUST</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;be enclosed by </span>[[HTML5]]<span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><a class="c2" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/rendering.html#flow-content-0">flow content</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">that carries an </span><span class="c4 c5 c18">epub:type</span> attribute with the value &quot;<span class="c4 c5 c18">assessment</span>&quot;<span class="c8">. In addition, each assessment </span><span class="c5 c38 c7">MUST </span><span class="c8">have an </span><code>id </code><span class="c8">attribute with a value that is unique with </span>the scope of the entire EPUB Publication. The value of this attribute will be used to identify the assessment when submitting outcome data.</p>
<pre class="example">
&lt;div epub:type=&quot;assessment&quot; id=&quot;unique_id&quot;&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p class="c35 c14">Each assessment marked up in this fashion will be able to report scores using the JavaScript APIs documented in <a class="c2" href="#h.dxf1o3gw16x0">section 6.3.3</a>. When adding outcome support to an assessment, there are no additional JavaScript files that must be included in the EPUB Publication.</p>
<p class="c35 c14">For outcomes to function and be identified inside of the Reading System and Tool Provider, an [[HTML5]]<span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><code>nav</code> element with with the <code>epub:type</code> attribute value &quot;<code>assessment</code><code>s</code>&quot; <span class="c5 c38 c7">MUST</span> be included in the EPUB Navigation Document.</p>
<p class="c35 c14">The link nodes within the assessment list <span class="c5 c38 c7">MUST</span> contain the following information:</p>
<ul><li><code>href:</code> a deep link to an assessment within the EPUB Publication. The link <span class="c5 c38 c7">MUST</span> point directly to an element that carries an <code>epub:type</code> attribute with the value &quot;<code>assessment</code>&quot; by using the value of its unique <code>id</code>. </li></ul>
<ul class="c34 lst-kix_s2puvsrh29n7-0"><li><code>data-maxscore</code>: Max possible score for the activity.</li><li><code>data-graded</code>: &quot;<code>1</code>&quot; if graded. &quot;<code>0</code>&quot; if not graded.</li><li>Each activity <span class="c5 c38 c7">MUST</span> have its own list item in the <code>nav</code> element:</li></ul>
<p class="c13"><span class="c0">Example:</span></p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;nav epub:type=&quot;assessments&quot;&gt;

<h2>LTI Links</h2>
<p class="c35 c14">An EPUB Content Document, which was not itself launched via an LTI link, will not be able to launch any embedded LTI links. In this case, the reading system needs to gracefully fail. </p>
<p class="c9 c14"><span class="c5 c20 c37">NOTE</span></p>
<p class="c23 c14">Performing an embedded LTI launch, assuming it is supported by the particular Reading Eco-system, involves performing a similar operation as <a class="c2" href="#h.nomfym85mx4l">reportScores</a> with a single exception: while some implementations of outcomes might allow the results to be enqueued there is no equivalent meaning to delaying an LTI launch. Therefore, an attempt to LTI launch to a tool on an offline device ought to fail.</p>

<h2>Authorization</h2>
<p class="c35 c14">This section defines the means of authorizing access from the Reading System to the Reading Eco-System. The APIs below <span class="c5 c38 c7">SHOULD</span> use an HTTP Authorization header that contains the TP-provided access-token (TP-Access-Token) that was provided to it at the initialization of the EPUB Publication. The TP-Access-Token enables two capabilities: 1) it ensures the message is allowed into the Tool Provider and 2) it provides a means of correlating the computed response to the invocation from the TP.</p>



<h3>6.5.1 Reading System responsibilities</h3>
<p>The Reading System has to fulfill several responsibilities, as outlined in the following subsections.</p>

<h4 class="c27 c9 c14"><span class="c11">6.5.1.1 At Reading System launch time</span></h4>
<p class="c35 c14">As described below in <a class="c2" href="#h.6yji37uaabty">Launching EPUB Publications</a>, when the Reading Eco-System launches an EPUB Publication it sends it a TP-Access-Token, and endpoints for services that it will require:</p>
<ul><li><code>launch_presentation_return_url</code>: redirect point when the book closes</li><li><code>result_handler_url</code>: path to the Tool Provider&rsquo;s result_handler to submit a result from the book</li><li><code>lti_launch_handler_url</code>: path to the Tool Provider&rsquo;s lti_launch_handler to start an embedded launch</li></ul>

<h4 class="c27 c9 c14"><span class="c11">6.5.1.2 At reportScores invocation</span></h4>
<p class="c35 c14">This event is activated when the content invokes <a class="c2" href="#h.nomfym85mx4l">EPUB.Education.reportScores</a>. It marshals the parameters described into the following:</p>
<p class="c35 c23 c14">POST to <code>result_handler_url</code> with Authorization Header containing a TP-Access-Token and a body containing the JSON media type with following &lsquo;flat&rsquo; fields</p>

<h2>Cross-system flows</h2>
<p>This section is informative</p>

<h3 class="c27 c14"><span class="c20">Flow 1: Provisioning Learning Activities</span></h3>
<p class="c35 c14">Before grades can be created in a LMS gradebook, a gradebook column for the particular assignment needs to be created. LTI calls this column the LineItem. For example, a calculus exercise might create the lineitem MinMax.question-3.</p>
<p class="c35 c23 c14"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 546.50px; height: 367.98px;"><img alt="" src="images/image04.png" style="width: 546.50px; height: 367.98px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="" /></span></p>

<h4 class="c27 c9 c14"><span class="c11">Steps</span></h4>
<ol class="c34 lst-kix_n1bl32jt8mqj-0 start" start="1"><li>[TC] Instructor clicks on an LTI link (v1.2 / 2.0+) in a Tool Consumer (TC). The particular LTI launch will initiate a user experience to create or manage lineitems. The user&rsquo;s launch is run within a context of a particular course and has to launch with a &lsquo;LineItems.url&rsquo; capability. This will pass to the Tool Provider (TP) an endpoint that will allow it access the lineitem container capability for the current course.</li><li>[TP] Accesses TOC metadata for the book.</li><li>[TP] Accesses the list of assessments available for an EPUB Publication as specified within the <span class="c4 c5 c89">assessments</span> nav element. A UX selector dialog allows the instructor to associate an assessment that is configured as &lsquo;gradeable&rsquo;, with a new lineitem. </li><li>[TP] Creates the new lineitem in the TC by POSTing to the lineitems url and providing it with the activity name and maxscore. (e.g., MinMax.question-3)</li></ol>
<p class="c9 c14"><span class="c5 c20 c37">NOTE</span></p>
<p class="c23 c14">It might seem odd that the gradebook lineitem which lives on the TC is provisioned by a UX that is running on the TP. The reason for this is an access control constraint. &nbsp;In LTI Outcomes V2 the lineitem is owned by the TP not the TC. Only the TP that creates the lineitem can operate on it; e.g., set a grade into it. The course gradebook might have many different lineitems for a course and each of these lineitems is protected from being accessed or modified by, say, another vendor&rsquo;s tool. It can only be maintained by the tool that creates it.</p>

<h3 class="c27 c14"><span class="c20">Flow 2: Launching EPUB Publications</span></h3>

<h4 class="c27 c9 c14"><span class="c11">Description</span></h4>
<p class="c35 c14">When the learner wants to use the EPUB Publication, the learner clicks on an LTI link to launch the book. This launch opens the book and passes some crucial information to the TP.</p>

<p class="c9 c14"><span class="c5 c20 c37">NOTE</span></p>
<p class="c23 c14">Particular implementations might have several implementation-defined fields. But the minimum values mentioned above are sufficient to recover launch-time state for most uses.</p>
<p class="c14 c52"></p>

<h3 class="c27 c14"><span class="c20">Flow 3: Outcome Flow</span></h3>
<p class="c35 c14">The following Outcome Flow is relevant to Method 2 outcomes as described above in section 6.2.2; that is, delegating outcomes to a server-based Tool Provider.</p>

<h4 class="c27 c9 c14"><span class="c11">Description</span></h4>
<p class="c35 c14">This flow shows the sequence of events for an assessment result submission and its forwarding through the Reading System, Tool Provider (TP), Tool Consumer (TC), and finally to gradebook</p>

<h3 class="c27 c14"><span class="c20">Flow 4: Embedded LTI </span><span class="c20">Launch</span></h3>

<h4 class="c27 c9 c14"><span class="c11">Description</span></h4>
<p class="c35 c14">An EPUB Publication can support embedded LTI launches. For example, a student at a learning institution can open an EPUB Publication and be reading it. The student comes upon a link to connect to publisher-supplied content, The student can directly &lsquo;Single-Sign-On&rsquo; (SSO) to the publisher site and review that content.</p>
<p class="c35 c14">There are many ways for an implementer to create an embedded launch. In the section on <a class="c2" href="#h.1mwdl97kcl51">Reading System conformance</a> there is great detail on the norms required. The following diagrams the two alternatives:</p>

<h5 class="c27 c9 c14"><span class="c76 c17">Alternative 1: Reading System hosts a Tool Consumer:</span></h5>
<p class="c35 c14"><span class="c5 c20 c85">CAUTION</span></p>
<p class="c23 c14">The constraints dictated in the Reading System Conformance section work fine for online Reading Systems in the same security domain as the Tool Provider, but avoid using it on lightweight, remote, or offline devices.</p>
<p class="c35 c14"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 515.50px; height: 277.80px;"><img alt="" src="images/image02.png" style="width: 515.50px; height: 277.80px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="" /></span></p>

<h4 class="c27 c9 c14"><span class="c11">Steps</span></h4>
<p class="c35 c14">Creating a Tool Consumer (TC) in any environment, whether within an LMS or within an EPUB Publication, is fully described in the [IMS Impl Guide 1.2] or [IMS Impl Guide 2.0+].</p>

<h4 class="c27 c9 c14"><span class="c11">Alternative 2: Reader delegates back to the Tool Provider:</span></h4>
<p class="c35 c14"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 504.50px; height: 319.78px;"><img alt="" src="images/image01.png" style="width: 504.50px; height: 319.78px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="" /></span></p>

<h4 class="c9 c14 c27"><span class="c11">Definition</span></h4>
<p class="c35 c26">An embedded launch that is delegated back through a Tool Provider requires that LTI metadata be stored that defines essential configuration data for an LTI launch. Most fundamentally, the metadata includes a consumer key, secret, and endpoint to direct the launch. Other launch metadata is optional.</p>
<p class="c35 c14">In LTI 2+ this kind of metadata is stored in a discrete resource called the LTI ToolProxy <a class="c2" href="#id.n5zvctjx12ei">[IMSToolProxy]</a>.</p>
<p class="c35 c14">But In LTI 1 there is no such resource. Rather this metadata is stored in vendor-specific locations at the discretion of the LTI 1 implementor. </p>
<p class="c35 c14">In the discussion below we will use the term ToolProxy informally. For LTI 2 systems it will indeed be the LTI ToolProxy. But for LTI 1 systems it will be some vendor-defined storage region that is capable of storing all essential LTI launch metadata.</p>

<h4 class="c27 c9 c14"><span class="c11">Preconditions</span></h4>
<p class="c35 c14">Certain provisioning is necessary on the Tool Provider to prepare for the Embedded LTI Launches.</p>
<ol class="c34 lst-kix_rifrsl816su5-0 start" start="1"><li>[TP] In advance of any embedded launch it is necessary to create a ToolProxy that will be needed to support the interactions between the Inner Tool Consumer and Inner Tool Provider (InnerTC and InnerTP). A ToolProxy is a formal interface contract that provides all the information needed to performs launches, services, or support other messages between LTI-compliant partners. The ToolProxy includes endpoints, credentials, and capabilities of the interactions. It is extensively described in the LTI media type documentation for <a class="c2" href="http://www.imsglobal.org/lti/model/mediatype/application/vnd/ims/lti/v2/toolproxy+json/index.html">application/vnd.ims.lti.v2.toolproxy+json</a>.</li><li>The ToolProxy can be created manually, by a vendor-provided tool, or automatically by using an LTI 2+ Registration flow.</li><li>The created ToolProxy should be stored in the ToolProvider in a location that is accessible to the embedded launch broker.</li></ol>

<h4 class="c27 c9 c14"><span class="c11">Flow</span></h4>
<ol class="c34 lst-kix_nvx7o6qch3x-0 start" start="1"><li>[EPUB 3] Document activity link signals a launch is requested. A JavaScript <code>launchActivity</code> method invokes the Reading System with information that identifies the launch metadata.</li><li>[Reading System] Reading System composes a POST with the original TP-access-token provided to access sources. It needs to pass three values to the Tool Provider (TP):</li></ol>
<ol class="c34 lst-kix_nvx7o6qch3x-1 start" start="1"><li>identifier of a TP-stored ToolProxy that defines the interface contract to the new &lsquo;inner&rsquo; tool being launched <a class="c2" href="#id.n5zvctjx12ei">[IMSToolProxy]</a></li><li>name of the ToolProxy resource (specific tool) to launch into </li><li>name assigned to the resource_link in the EPUB Publication. This value will be used for the resource_link_id of the &lsquo;inner&rsquo; launch <a class="c2" href="#id.rce0iiihhele">[IMSLTIImplGuide]</a> for the appropriate version.</li></ol>
<ol class="c34 lst-kix_nvx7o6qch3x-0" start="3"><li>[TP] TP uses the access token to recover the context of the &lsquo;outer&rsquo; launch. It then starts assuming the behavior of an &lsquo;inner&rsquo; Tool Consumer. </li><li>[InnerTC] First it looks up the ToolProxy for the inner launch that was referenced by the ReadingSystem. This interface contract gives details of the inner launch requirements including new endpoints, required parameters, signing details, etc. The innerTC derives launch parameters inherited from the outer launch and creates a new parameters for the inner launch. It transforms parameters based on the LTI Mapping Parameter table (below). Finally it signs the new launch parameters and redirects to the innerTP with the LTI POST-autosubmit idiom <a class="c2" href="#id.rce0iiihhele">[IMSLTIImplGuide]</a>.</li><li>[InnerTP] Behaves as any LTI launch. It renders its tool, lets the user interact. If it performs outcomes handling (either V1 or V2 outcomes) it performs them in the usual fashion and returns them via the endpoints provided in the inner launch (from the ToolProxy).</li><li>[InnerTP] It finally redirects, using the normal launch_presentation_return_url to the ancestor TP.</li><li>[InnerTC] Any returned results from the InnerTP need to be brokered back to the TP. This involves forwarding the message to the outer consumer after re-signing it.</li><li>[TP] continues in the outer launch activity (e.g., in the EPUB Publication). </li></ol>

<h4 class="c27 c9 c14"><span class="c11">LTI Mapping Parameters</span></h4>
<p class="c35 c69 c14">The following table shows the different LTI parameter categories and how they are handled in a brokered launch situation. Note that the Mapping column indicates the forward mappings (outer-to-inner launch). The final row shows the mappings required for reverse mappings. This is typically for inner results being passed back.</p><table class="c84"><tbody><tr class="c15"><td class="c28" colspan="1" rowspan="1">

<p>The sourced_tool_consumer_instance_guid requires special comment. It is used in to disambiguate user identity when LTI launches (either direct or embedded) come into a tool from possible different sources; i.e. through different embedded launches or a parallel communication from the origin Tool Consumer to the final Tool Provider.</p>

&nbsp;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;</pre>




<p>As the nature of the brief table of contents is more structurally fluid than simple lists of links, it is typically not included in the EPUB Navigation Document, as <code>nav</code> elements in that document are subject to the restrictions defined in <a class="c2" href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-nav-def-model">2.2.4.1 The </a><span class="c6 c4"><a class="c2" href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-nav-def-model">nav</a></span><a class="c2" href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-nav-def-model">&nbsp;element: Restrictions</a> <span class="c6 c7"><a class="c2" href="#kix.i7mkocc0itmb">[ContentDocs301]</a></span>.

<h2>Content Lists</h2>
<p>If an EPUB Publication includes figures, tables, and/or audio and video content, it is strongly encouraged that navigation lists for these be included in the EPUB Navigation Document, as inclusion simplifies access to the content for all Users.</p>
<p>A figure list is identified by adding the &quot;<span class="c6 c4"><a class="c2" href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure/#loi&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-Q0mTsU-gUWKJNW90c8fcJGMtKg">loi</a></span>&quot; term to a nav element, a table list by the &quot;<span class="c6 c4"><a class="c2" href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure/#lot&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEhgLZn7g9HGFCddU6sKKuRu-XbaA">lot</a></span>&quot; term, and audio and video lists by the &quot;<span class="c6 c4"><a class="c2" href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure/#loa&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqk2HyvUxwXHWp7FwvlpRsq4XRNA">loa</a></span>&quot; and &quot;<span class="c6 c4"><a class="c2" href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure/#lov&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHPX45UkxlBgPy7bxihvzklPPCRDw">lov</a></span>&quot; terms, respectively <a class="c2" href="#id.vamrleack432">[StructureVocab]</a>.</p>

<h2>Educational Metadata</h2>

<section>

<h3 class="c14">Educational Properties</h3>
<p>Educational metadata is needed to describe the suitability of content for educational settings, and to facilitate search and retrieval.</p>
<p>The [[schema.org]] <a href="http://schema.org/CreativeWork">CreativeWork</a> type includes <a href="http://www.lrmi.net/the-specification">educational metadata properties</a> that Authors can set in the EPUB Package Document to identify the nature and suitability of the content. In addition, the [[schema.org]] <a href="http://www.schema.org/EducationalAudience">EducationalAudience</a> type can be used to express the intended audience of the work. This specification does not require the use of any of these properties.</p>

<p>The usage recommendations in the following subsections are suggested based on the intended audience: schools, higher education, and professional/technical/corporate.</p>


<p class="note">See the <span class="c6 c4"><a class="c2" href="#h.eufqqw4y93wy">audience/audienceType</a></span><a class="c2" href="#h.eufqqw4y93wy">&nbsp;property</a> for how to declare this audience.</p>



<p>In some cases, a default value is assumed for educational properties when they are not specified in the metadata. Default values are indicated in the allowed values sections.</p>


<p class="note">A mapping between schema.org and IMS metadata properties is provided in <a class="c2" href="#h.9qmzaj2iy9jn">Appendix E.1</a>.</p>


<p>This specification does not enforce case-sensitivity on the values of these properties. If Reading Systems or other processing agents seek to utilize these properties for specialized behaviors, they MUST normalize the case of their values prior to evaluation.</p>

<h2>Accessibility Metadata</h2>
<p>Identifying the accessible qualities of an EPUB Publication is of vital importance in educational contexts, as the needs and preferences of students will dictate whether any given Rendition of the content will be sufficiently usable by them in their studies.</p>
<p>The <a class="c2" href="#id.u8pfppgkhclt">[schema.org]</a> <a class="c2" href="http://schema.org/CreativeWork">CreativeWork</a> type includes <a class="c2" href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Accessibility#Accessibility_terms_.28Version_1.0.29">accessibility metadata properties</a> <a class="c2" href="#id.xz4g70opa1sd">[A11YProperties]</a> that Authors can set in the EPUB Package Document to identify the accessible qualities of a given Rendition of the EPUB Publication.</p>
<p>Authors MUST use the <code>accessibilityFeature</code> property to identify any applicable accessibility features, repeating the property for each feature. A recommended list of values to use with this property is maintained at the <a class="c2" href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Accessibility">W3C Web Schemas wiki</a> <a class="c2" href="#id.xz4g70opa1sd">[A11YProperties]</a>.</p>
<p>At a minimum, all EPUB Publications that conform to this profile MUST specify the value &quot;<code>tableOfContents</code>&quot;, as a complete table of contents is required as described in <a class="c2" href="#h.lmfoatmvs6h7">7.1 Table of Contents</a>. It is strongly RECOMMENDED that the other properties be specified whenever applicable. Note, however, that It is not valid to include the value &quot;<code>none</code>&quot;, as there is always at least one value that can be specified.</p>
<p>Refer to the schema.org metadata integration guide <a class="c2" href="#kix.flpag8ity5n9">[</a><a class="c2" href="#kix.flpag8ity5n9">SchemaGuide</a><a class="c2" href="#kix.flpag8ity5n9">]</a> more information on how to include these properties in the Package Document.</p>
<p>In distribution contexts that require the use of an ONIX record, the accessibility properties defined in <a class="c2" href="http://www.editeur.org/ONIX/book/codelists/current.html#codelist196">Code List 196</a> <a class="c2" href="#id.vgmyhvfp609r">[ONIXCodes]</a> SHOULD be specified, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note">A <a class="c2" href="http://www.a11ymetadata.org/the-specification/metadata-crosswalk/">mapping table from the ONIX to schema.org frameworks</a> is available on the <a class="c2" href="http://www.a11ymetadata.org/">a11ymetadata.org</a> site.</p>

<h1>Distributable Educational Objects</h1>

<section>

<h2 class="c14 c87">Introduction</h2>
<p><span class="c20 c61 c7">This section is informative</span></p>
<p>In educational contexts, there is a need to distribute and consume not only complete publications, but components of publications and other objects not necessarily originating within a publication. Such &quot;distributable objects&quot; could be complete EPUB Content Documents (for example, a chapter of a book), sections of such a document (for example, an exercise or a set of learning objectives), media resources (such as a video or an interactive feature), or a combination of such resources that are not necessarily contiguous within the parent EPUB Publication.</p>
<p>This section provides the specifications that pertain to creating Distributable Objects <a class="c2" href="#id.nw43utigbbdw">[DistributableObjects]</a> that are intended for education and which conform to this specification.</p>

</section>

<section>

<h2>Identification</h2>

<h3>10.2.1 Distributable Object Type</h3>
<p>This specification does not define a specific type of Distributable Object to identify educational content.</p>
<p>For general educational content distribution needs, the <code>distributable-object</code> type defined in the <a class="c2" href="#id.nw43utigbbdw">[DistributableObjects]</a> is RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>Other, more specific types, such as EPUB Scriptable Components <a class="c2" href="#id.7atrcwg4xy4k">[ESC]</a>, MAY be used, as appropriate (provided the Distributable Object conforms to all requirements in the respective specification).</p>


<h3>10.2.2 Education Conformance</h3>
<p>To simplify (re)use and integration in workflows, distribution channels and EPUB Publications, any Distributable Object whose content conforms to this profile MAY be identified as conformant. The following metadata MUST be expressed to indicate conformance:</p>
<ol class="c34 lst-kix_fcd4b8lkflm5-0 start" start="1"><li>all requirements defined in <a class="c2" href="#h.nsjfhxwfp3rp">8. Publication Metadata</a>; and</li><li>the addition of an additional <span class="c6 c4"><a class="c2" href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html#sec-opf-dctype">dc:type</a></span><a class="c2" href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html#sec-opf-dctype">&nbsp;element</a> <a class="c2" href="#kix.gcfl4rhpnwhm">[Publications301]</a> with the identifier &quot;<code>education</code>&quot;.</li></ol>
<p>In the case of <a class="c2" href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/do/#h.fkrugm9n2us3">Packaged Objects</a> <a class="c2" href="#id.nw43utigbbdw">[DistributableObjects]</a>, this metadata is expressed in the <a class="c2" href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html#sec-metadata-elem">package metadata</a> <a class="c2" href="#kix.gcfl4rhpnwhm">[Publications301]</a>. For Embedded Objects <a class="c2" href="#id.nw43utigbbdw">[DistributableObjects]</a>, the metadata is expressed in the <a class="c2" href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html#elemdef-collection-metadata">collection metadata</a> <a class="c2" href="#kix.gcfl4rhpnwhm">[Publications301]</a>.</p>

</section>

<section>

<h2>Embedded Objects</h2>
<p>As Distributable Objects are created and consumed for many purposes, it is not a requirement that all the Distributable Objects used in a Rendition be identified as conforming to this profile.</p>
<p>If the Author is responsible for the creation of a Distributable Object in a compliant EPUB Publication, however, it is RECOMMENDED that the Distributable Object be <a class="c2" href="#h.rasm7lzcxncv">identified</a> as conforming to the profile.</p>
<p>EPUB Publications conformant with this profile MAY embed any type of Distributable Object provided the resulting Rendition(s) remain conformant to the requirements of this specification.</p>
